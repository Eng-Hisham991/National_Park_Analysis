This project gathered and analysed data pertaining to factors that may influence National Parks.

We used data from a variety of APIs including
* NPS
* NPS STAT
* Census Data
* Dark Sky API
* EIA data
_(although we tested many more including openweather and myfuelbuddy)_

Despite the layout of this repository we were _very organized_

All our code is documented and explained in 

* project1_group2_AA.ipynb
